datatypes in python
---------------------
the following types of datatypes are avaiable in python
1. None --- null value
2. sequence -- (bytes, bytearray, list, tuple, range) -- (it is basically an array)
3. Set
4. Mapping -- dictionary hold values in key and value pair
5. numeric type

-----> the purpose of datatypes is to identify the type of value a variable holds

what is a variable?
---> a variable is that who stores some value
---> a varible in python doen't need to be specified the datatype externally.


example
-----
a=10
means a is integer value
b=10.3
b is float kind of value

----> in python the type of value decides what kind of varible that is.
----> according to the type of value the datatype is decided


sequence
---------
it is basically an array where elements are stored.

str 
-----
it is called as string and it is basically array of characters.

bytes-- this represents group of elements in the form  of numbers in byte.
2. these are stored in the form of array.
3. the elements canot be modified.

bytearray --- this is same as byte but here modification is possible.

list-
it is same as array.
it holds duplicate elements as well as heterogenous elements.
items can be modified here.
it can store different elements dynamically into it.
all the elements are stored inside []
the underlying datastructure is array

tuple
-----
it is also same as list.
it can hold duplicate elements as well as heterogenous elements.
but the only difference is it is not dynamic.
the underlying datastructure is array.
we cannot add or modify the elements from tuple.
all the elements are represented inside ().

range function
------------
range function is used for repeating a for loop.


Set
----
1. only homogeneous elements are accepted
2. insertion order is not followed.
3. unordered datastructure
4. represented inside {}

mappings
-----------
it is also called as dictionary
here the elements are stored in key & value pair format
